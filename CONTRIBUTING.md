This guide describes how you can contribute improvements to the ArcGIS Viewer for Flex Thematic Widget source code.

The [ArcGIS Viewer for Flex Thematic Widget](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ced1ad5fe30f4304adb056cdcbdc9ad0) is a sample widget that was originally built by Lloyd Heberlie at [Esri](http://www.esri.com) and has had many contributions from the Flex Team at [Esri](http://www.esri.com). We are excited that you are interested in improving the thematic-widget-flex source code. This guide will help make sure your contribution (pull request) will be accepted and easily merged.

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [Thematic Widget repo](../../) on GitHub.
3. Clone it to your local machine.
4. Checkout the [develop branch](../../tree/develop).
5. Create a new feature branch on your local machine.
	* The name of the branch doesn't matter, but as a best practice use a descriptive name like "fix-look-of-widgetgroup-hover-state".
6. Write code to add an enhancement or fix the problem.  
	* Follow the coding conventions already used in the Thematic Widget source code (spaces instead of tabs, proper indentation, use [Flex Formatter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexformatter/files/) along with our [Flex Formatter settings](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex/blob/develop/FlexFormatter.properties)).
	* Document your code.
	* Make commits of logical units.
	* Use [clear and descriptive commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
7. Test your code.
