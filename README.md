<!-- repository description -->
This repository includes:

* The widget source code to showcase how to dynamically generate symbology from an [ArcGIS service](http://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Census/MapServer) and use that symbology with a dynamic map service.
* A non-widget sample to showcase how to dynamically generate symbology from an [ArcGIS service](http://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Census/MapServer) and use that symbology with a dynamic map service.
* Read the [Change Log](https://github.com/lheberlie/thematic-widget-flex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details on what's new.
* Read the [Documentation](https://github.com/lheberlie/thematic-widget-flex/wiki) for getting started using this repository.

## Features
* Want to see how you take an example of a custom widget template, apply an ArcGIS API for Flex sample, and package a custom widget for distribution with the Application Builder?  Then you should keep reading.
* This code sample provides one example of a code template for a custom widget, as well as a finished code sample that has integrated the "Generate Renderers" sample from the ArcGIS API for Flex Resource Center.
* Who is this code sample for?  You're looking for an example how to convert an API sample into a widget.  You'd like a sample that provides a starting template for most widgets.  You're interested in how to package widgets for Application Builder.

**Note**:  This code sample was designed to support the 2012 Esri User Conference session **ArcGIS Viewer for Flex - Advanced Topics** Technical Workshop.
